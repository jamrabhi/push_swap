# push_swap
42 - This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

Algo used : radix sort for more than 5 numbers

## Usage :
```bash
$> make
$> ./push_swap [list of numbers to sort]
```
